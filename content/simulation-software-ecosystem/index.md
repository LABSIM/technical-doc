title: The LABSIM Simulation Software Ecosystem
weight: 10
---

## Scientific fields 

<br>

The LABSIM simulatiom software ecosystem mainly cover 2 Applied Computer Science sub-fields :
 
* Distributed Systems.

* Software Engineering.

And a much more transverse one :

* **VR** (Virtual-Reality) and it's extension **AR** (Augmented-Reality) & **MR** (Mixed-Reality).

## Guidelines 

<br>

As a rule of thumb, we stated 5 guidelines since early conception stage of the LABSIM simulation software ecosystem. And these rules are not something we get out of nowhere, they are not the result of a hype brainstorming that we could have held once in a really secret HQ with superstar dev & amazing buisnessman. 

Well... ***Nope***. 

They are what researcher *care about* when they have deal with *real-time piloted simulation studies*. They simply are the "polished" needs of our rearcher. As simple as it sounds. At least, we *hope* it is :)

<br>

### 1. Human-centered

Once again, *real-time piloted simulation*. 

And by piloted, we mean that our subject of interest is mainly a human beeing operator and our evaluation criteria could be : simulation fidelity, acceptability, ergomomy, piloting performance, neuroergonomy, agency, sense of control, multi-agent collaboration... So, we naturally design our ecosystem to match some human-oriented design theory for real-time simulation, as said, the **VR**.

Our main source of inspiration came from these two sketches.

### 2. Performance focused 

### 3. Modular

### 4. Multi-disciplinar

### 5. Code-less

## Software Topology

## Software Architecture

## Model Integration Pipeline

## Simulation Composition Pipeline
